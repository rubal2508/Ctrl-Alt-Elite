I brought the shirt in and took it out of the bag and tried it on. keep in mind I am almost 400 lb s and I bought a 6xl just for kicks , I only bought one because you never know but anyway I tried it on and it fits with plenty of room. it also comes longer than the average shirt so it stops around your pocket. and the fabric was great, it has just a little give but won't stretch out of shape. great buy for less than $8. going to stock up.",

        "Comment": "Very stiff material, didn't want to attempt to stretch as I felt like the material would rip. Ordered in a 5xl as I like my shirts super baggy but these did not work. They were loose in the mid section and sleeves but the bottom hugged which is what didn't want to give to be stretched. The sleeves came a lil over half way down my arm tho so I ended up returning and found something else",

But this Hanes was the ONLY correct color. However, Hanes didn't HAVE it in women's or in smaller men's sizes. Lucky me! I can sew! So I bought the remaining XXXXLg men's size, and easily cut out a perfect shirt for myself. Great match! What do you think? Yes, I'm old- 76! Girls in my generation ALL knew how to sew!",

        "Comment": "The fatigue green color is really nice. Love the color. It also feels a bit different than the other colors. I would say maybe stiffer, able to hold shape more, almost feeling thicker. It also runs a tiny bit smaller than the blue and black shirts Iâ€™ve purchased.",

I wear F.Y.I with my pm bottoms,probably out two people in the shirt,but I like all the extra room! I have MS and sometimes it hurts for me to wear clothes,that's one reason why I get them so big",
